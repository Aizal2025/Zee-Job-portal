# Zee Job LMS

A full-stack job listing portal built for the major-project
requirement: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend, database, full-stack,
user roles, listings/applications, deployment.**

Data is stored in local JSON files on the server (`data/`) instead of
the browser's localStorage — so it's shared across every browser/device
that opens the site, and survives a page refresh or a server restart.

## What it does

- **Find Job** — browse open roles, search by title/company/tag
- **Candidate accounts** — sign up, log in, apply to a role (one-click,
  duplicate applies are blocked)
- **Admin account** — log in, add/edit/delete listings, see everyone
  who applied and to which role
- Two user roles enforced by the backend: `candidate` and `admin`

## Default admin login

```
email:    admin@zee.com
password: admin123
```

This is seeded automatically the first time the server runs. Change
it (or add a real admin-management flow) before deploying anywhere
public.

## Deployment

This is a Node app (not a static site), so it needs a Node host —
e.g. Render, Railway, Replit, or a college server with Node
installed. Steps:

1. Push this folder to a Git repo (or upload it directly on the host).
2. Set the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable to a random string
   (the code falls back to a demo secret if you don't).
3. Run `npm install` then `npm start` — most platforms detect the
   `start` script automatically.
4. Put the live URL in your project report.


## Updates

- Search + job-type filter on Find Job page
- Application status (pending / accepted / rejected): admin sets it, candidate sees it under "My applications"
- `PUT /api/applications/:id/status` (admin only)
- Env vars: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET` (set both before deploying)
- Login rate-limit, email format check, central error handler
- Cube animation removed, slimmer mobile navbar
